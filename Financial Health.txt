Financial health is a composite measurement of an individual’s financial life. Unlike narrow metrics such as credit scores, financial health assesses whether people are spending, saving, borrowing, and planning in ways that will enable them to be resilient and pursue opportunities. We measure financial health using our proprietary FinHealth Score® framework, which is based on eight survey questions that align with the eight indicators of financial health.
