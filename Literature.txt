Literature serves as a mirror to society, reflecting its values, conflicts, and aspirations through written works. Literary analysis involves the critical examination of texts, uncovering deeper meanings, cultural contexts, and authorial intent. From classical epics to contemporary novels, literature provides profound insights into the human condition and societal evolution. Through various analytical lenses, including feminist, psychoanalytic, and post-colonial theories, literary analysis enriches our understanding of texts and broadens our perspective on the multifaceted human experience. Exploring literature and engaging in its analysis allows us to connect with diverse narratives and historical epochs, fostering empathy and critical thinking.
